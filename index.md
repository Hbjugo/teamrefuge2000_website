With Christmas coming up very soon, you must have seen them everywhere, or they were given to you when you were a child: the oh-so-stereotyped Christmas gifts. When little girls receive baby dolls, makeup kits and fashion sketchbooks, little boys are blessed with dinosaurs, fire engines, and false hardware tools. The new generations of parents are more and more aware that these stereotyped gifts are founded on nonsense assumptions, such as “a girl’s dream is to be the prettiest” and “every boy wishes to join the army”. Moreover, it has been shown that this entire sexist mindset has led, among other consequences, to professional categories showing a very small number of women enrolled. Just look at EPFL, or any other engineering school …

With this project, we decided to work on another part of our culture which appears in our mind as a good representative of gender stereotypes: movies. In fact, while doing some research on the movie industry in order to decide with which angle we would like to approach our dataset, we came across this sentence: 

“If [Marilyn Monroe] still fascinates us so much, it is because her story echoes the diktat that continues to mark out women's lives in a world controlled by the male gaze.” 

This powerful observation signes the introduction of the documentary “Becoming Marilyn”, released in 2021 by Arte Cinema. And it taught us two things: that women characters have failed to be more than projections of men’s expectations, and that the cinema in itself can be consider as a representation of our society and its diktats.

With this project, we would like to tackle the subject of gender representation in movies across time. Strong believers that women are more than gentle creatures and men are not only super strong, we want to investigate if the movies industry followed and still follows these stereotypes, and how does it varies between countries and movies genres.

### A. what is the gender parity across movie genres (are westerns still as male dominated as the stereotype describes it?)

### B. what is the evolution of gender parity in films among countries over time (were some countries avant-garde? Are some still behind on this concept?)

As a next analysis, we wanted to determine how the gender parity is distributed among different countries, and how this rate changed over time. First, we saw how it is currently distributed all over the world, and plotted it on a heatmap.

As we can see, the USA 

### C. Is there a variation in the box office revenue depending on the gender parity? Has it change over the years?

### D. Is there a variation of the main attributes -agent verbs, patient verbs and attributes- given to each gender across time?

### E. Do the mean age of the actors, male and female, evolves over the years? (with the cliché in mind that +40-year-old actresses are "outdated")

### F. Can we built the perfect archetypes of the male and female actor (age, height, ethnicity) over time?
