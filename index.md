"If [Marilyn Monroe] still fascinates us so much, it is because her story echoes the diktat that continues to mark out women's lives in a world controlled by the male gaze."

It is by this powerful observation that the documentary "Becoming Marilyn", released in 2021 by Arte Cinema, is introduced. This tells us two things: that women characters have failed to be more than projections of men's expectations, and that the cinema in itself can be consider as a representation of our society and its diktats.

With this project, we would like to tackle the subject of gender representation in movies across time. Strong believers that women are more than gentle creatures and men are not only super strong, we want to investigate if the movies industry followed and still follows these stereotypes, and how does it varies between countries and movies genres.

### A. what is the gender parity across movie genres (are westerns still as male dominated as the stereotype describes it?)

### B. what is the evolution of gender parity in films among countries over time (were some countries avant-garde? Are some still behind on this concept?)

As a next analysis, we wanted to determine how the gender parity is distributed among different countries, and how this rate changed over time. First, we saw how it is currently distributed all over the world, and plotted it on a heatmap.

### C. Is there a variation in the box office revenue depending on the gender parity? Has it change over the years?

### D. Is there a variation of the main attributes -agent verbs, patient verbs and attributes- given to each gender across time?

### E. Do the mean age of the actors, male and female, evolves over the years? (with the clich√© in mind that +40-year-old actresses are "outdated")

### F. Can we built the perfect archetypes of the male and female actor (age, height, ethnicity) over time?
